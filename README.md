## Pa-Auk Tawya Meditation Manual Course Book &amp; others

Recently I lost many GB (nearly all) of digital Dhamma resources on my storage devices.

I had to manually collect them again which took time and efforts. So now I try to "back up/log" online some of the important resources. Due to my Internet data package limit, I can not upload all here.
